        <p>Nice Direct is a limited company incorporated in Kenya. Nice Direct is not a Coffee trading company and does not buy or sell Coffee. Nice Directs’ role is facilitating availability of the Site or Application that connects Producers and Buyers and enables them to trade in Coffee and links them to Facilitators who support the ensuing trade. Producers create Accounts where they exhibit their Coffees and farming activities, Buyers create Accounts through which they search for available Coffees, order samples and order Coffee while Facilitators who include warehousemen, logisticians, shippers, insurance agencies and banks provide services to support ensuing trade. All these collectively are referred to herein as the “Platform”. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Creating a Producer Account</h4>
        <p>As a Producer, you may be eligible to create an Account through which you can sell Coffee directly to Buyers and the ability to export Coffees from the producing country if laws and regulations in your country allow you to do so. To create an Account, you will be required to provide information about yourself, your farm and your Coffees including, but not limited to the location, quality, quantity, features, availability and pricing in US Dollars and related rules and financial terms. You will also be required to show proof that you are legally eligible to sell Coffee as per the laws and regulations of your country.</p>
        <p>You understand and agree to provide samples for quality evaluation which will be done by Platform Facilitators who carry out cupping evaluation and quality control. Nice Direct will facilitate such cupping on behalf of Producer and Buyer and will thereafter post the cupping report on the Producers Account. </p>
        <p>Buyers will be able to view and buy your Coffee on the Platform based on the information you provide. You will not be allowed to increase the price of the Coffee as posted on your Account. </p>
        <p>You agree to take full responsibility for the Account you create and represent and warrant that the information you provide on your Account is truthful and that by selling any Coffee on your Account, you are not breaching any other agreement you may have with third parties and that you are in compliance with all applicable tax requirements, rules, regulations, required permits, licenses and registrations that may apply to any Coffees included in your Account. </p>
        <p>Nice Direct reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove any posted Coffees or disable access to any Account for any reason, if Nice Direct in its sole discretion, considers posted Coffee or an active Account to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Platform or Platform Members or breaches existing laws, rules and regulations. </p>
        <p>The Producer commits to inform Nice Direct of any events of Force Majeure or otherwise that affect availability or quality of listed Coffees. </p>
        <p>By using the Platform you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Nice Direct to such actions or omissions. </p>
        <p>You agree to provide the coffee on sale to be shipped and stored in Nice Direct warehouses in the market countries. Nice Direct will provide pre-financing for shipment and storage and will arrange final fulfillment which includes delivery to buyer’s doorstep. Depending on prevailing circumstances, the pre-financing may extend to an advance payment to the producer equal to as much as 50% of the value of the coffee prior to the coffee’s shipment or sale. The said pre-financing will be subject to an interest as set by Nice Direct.  </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Creating a Buyer Account</h4> 
        <p>As a Buyer, you are eligible to create an Account through which you can view listed Coffees, order samples and order Coffees. To create an Account, you will be required to provide information about yourself, and your business. You will also be required to show proof that you are a legally eligible business as per the laws and regulations of your country. </p>
        <p>You agree to take full responsibility for the Account you create and represent and warrant that the information you provide on your Account is truthful and that you are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Platform. </p>
        <p>Nice Direct reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to disable access to any Account for any reason, if Nice Direct in its sole discretion, considers existence of a Buyers Account to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these terms, or otherwise harmful to the Platform or Platform Members or breaches existing laws, rules and regulations. </p>
        <p>As a Buyer, you understand and agree that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Producer for ordered Coffees and that you will be responsible for fulfilling any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions imposed by the Producer. </p>
        <p>By using the Platform you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Nice Direct to such actions or omissions. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>How the Platform works</h4> 
        <p>•	After milling, coffee is graded and packed ready for shipping</p>
        <p>•	We provide pre-finances to give farmer an advance payment and to cater for logistics</p>
        <p>•	Coffee is shipped to destination country and warehoused</p>
        <p>•	Profiles of the coffee are posted on the platform and samples are availed to buyers</p>
        <p>•	Buyers order coffee and pay directly to farmer's account</p>
        <p>•	The payment system first settles pre-financed amounts</p> 
        <p>•	The remainder is paid to the farmer</p>  
        <p>•	Nice Direct ships the coffee to buyers premises</p> 
        <p>•	Information on the order including what ended up in the farmer's pocket is shared for all transacting parties</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Payment system</h4>
        <p>You acknowledge that the agency chosen by Nice Direct to provide a payment system for the Platform serves as the authorized payment collection agent of the Producer for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Producer, payments from Buyers of such amounts stipulated on the Platform including fees, charges, and/or taxes and additional charges that may exist up to compliance with shipment to Buyer’s premises. </p>


        <h4>Order cancellations</h4> 
        <p>Orders can be cancelled by the Producer, the Buyer or Nice Direct before or after confirmation, for but not limited to the following reasons: </p>
        <p>-	If the Buyer is not able to pay within the required duration </p>
        <p>-	If the Producer is not able to sell the Coffee ordered due to an event of Force Majeure or otherwise that affects availability or quality of listed Coffees </p>
        <p>-	If Nice Direct in its own discretions deems it fit to cancel an order </p>
        <p>If any party wishes to cancel an order, they should send an email indicating the same to Nice Direct through admin@nicedirect.com </p>
        <p id="hsdj9d">If, as a Buyer, you cancel a confirmed order made via the Platform after the Coffee has already been delivered to the shipping address, you commit to pay all costs generated up to delivery. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Bucket list (Reservation)</h4>
        <p>As a buyer, you can make reservations of coffees that are expected to be in stock in the future. All such reservations follow the criteria below:</p>
